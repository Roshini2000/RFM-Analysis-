# RFM-Analysis-

RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers.
Recency (R) - Time since last purchase
Frequency (F) - Total number of purchases
Monetary value (M) - Total monetary value

To perform RFM analysis, we divide customers into four equal groups according to the distribution of values for recency, frequency, and monetary value.
